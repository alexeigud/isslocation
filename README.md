React app that displays the longitude, latitude and timestamp of the Internation Space Station and updates every 1000ms

Until I find a solution I cannot display mixed content. I am hosting the app in GitHub Pages over HTTPS and trying to fetch and display API JSON content over HTTP. See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content
